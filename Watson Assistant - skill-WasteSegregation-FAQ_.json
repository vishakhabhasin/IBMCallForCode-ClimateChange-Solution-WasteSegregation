It can include paper, plastics, metal, glass, rubber, thermocol, Styrofoam, fabric, leather, rexine, wood –anything that can be kept for an extended period without decomposing.\n\n2. It doesn't smell if you store it for a week if it is clean and dry. Make sure that plastic sachets of milk, curds, oil, any food item, are cleaned of all their contents and dried before being put in the dry waste bag. Then they will never stink.\n\n3. Clean dry waste will not attract any vermin. Only if any food residue or organic matter is present in the dry waste you will face cockroach, rats and flies problems.\n\t\n4. For storing pizza and cake boxes, clean the pizza or cake boxes of all food residue – with a wet kitchen cloth, or rinse them quickly in water and let them dry out before putting them in the dry waste container.\n\n5. To store pickle & sauce bottles, they should be rinsed thoroughly with water. Pickle bottles need to be cleaned with soap and water, as they contain oil. Basically, no food residue must be left in the bottles. Clean them as you would to reuse them.\n\n6. The milk packets, batter packets, and yoghurt containers need to ve cleaned thoroughly. Open out the milk, yoghurt and batter packets completely at one end, and wash out all the residue. They can be put to wash with the dishes in the sink, then dried,and put into the dry waste bag.\n\n7. Any plastic containing any food has to be rinsed, or washed with soap and water if required, before being put into the dry waste bag.\n\n8. Rinse juice containers/ tetra packs otherwise ants will be attracted to the sugar in the juice.\n\n9. Make sure all the bread / biscuit crumbs are shaken out of the packet, so they do not attract ants. If the biscuits are too oily, the packet may need to be washed with soap and water.\n\n10. For old clothes/ shoes/ handbags/ belts/ toys, if they are still in usable condition, they should be given to some organization that collects them. If they are totally unusable, or very damaged, they are still categorized as dry waste.\n\n11. Do the same with your old bed linen/ mattress/ pillows etc as mentioned above.\n\n12. Old furniture/ broken glass table can be recycled, if not, along with broken glass it can be handed over separately to Dry Waste Collection Centres.\n\n13. Old crockery / non-stick pans etc, if they are not broken, they are recyclable dry waste.\n\n14. Old taps – recyclable dry waste. Broken sanitary ware – debris or rubbish.\n\t\n15. The best method of storing Dry Waste is to store it in a bag/bin in the utility area after cleaning and drying till it is picked up.\n"

Wet waste consists of kitchen waste - including vegetable and fruit peels and pieces, tea leaves, coffee grounds, eggshells, bones and entrails, fish scales, as well as cooked food (both veg and non-veg).\n\n2. Learn to compost at home. Home composting can be easily done in Daily Dump’s pot system, or in any aerated container.\n\n3. If you live in a large apartment building or you don’t have time to compost at home your alternatives could be a community composting system like tank composting or an OWC could be set up for all the wet waste from the residents. If not, the wet waste can be given out every day to the MC.\n\n4. Don’t use a plastic liner for the bin for disposing of the food waste in the bin. Before the advent of the bin liner, we would all put our garbage directly in the bin, and wash it everyday. That is what we will have to do now. The bin can be lined with a newspaper liner or a layer of sawdust if you don’t want to put the wet waste directly into it.\n\n5. To dispose dog poop, wrap in a newspaper, mark with a red cross, and give everyday to the MC along with wet waste. In case the dog or cat has loose motions, do the same with the cloth used to mop up the liquid poop.\n\n6. Garden waste will be collected by the MC on specified days or can be dropped off at the nearest specified park for composting.\n\n*MC = Municipal Corporation"
